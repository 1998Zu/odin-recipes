# odin-recipes
This is my first project. In this project I will build a basic recipes website. This site will have a main index page with links to a few recipes. The idea is for me to acquire some HTML chops, as such it won't be very pretty. I hope to demonstate skills in creating a repository, cloning that onto my local machine etc.

Wrtting the code wasn't difficult, I haven't done any of the hard stuff yet. I did have difficulty with putting up the 3rd picture though. I found out that it was corrupted sometime in the download process and fixed it.
